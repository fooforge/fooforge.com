It's a bit of short notice, but tomorrow, I'm going to speak about my experience from 1 1/2 years working at GitHub and what it's like to work remotely for a company abroad. The #rughh will gather at around 7 PM at the [betahaus 2.0](http://hamburg.betahaus.de/). You can let us know that you're coming by signing up on [#rughh's webiste](http://hamburg.onruby.de/events/ruby-usergroup-hamburg-juni-2014).

> betahaus hamburg
> EifflerstraÃŸe 43
> 22769 Hamburg

I'd prefer giving the talk in German, but we'll see about that at the venue.
