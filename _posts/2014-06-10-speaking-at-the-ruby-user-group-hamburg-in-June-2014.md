It's a bit of short notice, but tomorrow I'm going to speak about my experience from 1 1/2 years working at GitHub and what it's like to work remotely for a company abroad. The Ruby user group will gather at around 7 PM at the [betahaus 2.0](http://hamburg.betahaus.de/). You can let us know that you're coming by signing up on [#rughh's website](http://hamburg.onruby.de/events/ruby-usergroup-hamburg-juni-2014).

> betahaus hamburg  
> Eifflerstraße 43  
> 22769 Hamburg

I'd prefer giving the talk in German, but we'll see about that at the venue.
