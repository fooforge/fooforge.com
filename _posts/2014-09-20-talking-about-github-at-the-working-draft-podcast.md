**Disclaimer:**  
The podcast's in German.

Earlier this month I was invited to the Working Draft podcast's [Revision 187](http://workingdraft.de/187/) by [Stefan Baumgartner](http://fettblog.eu) and [Christian Schaefer](https://twitter.com/derSchepp) to talk about what it's like to be a *GitHubber*. And that's what we did at great length! We've been talking about how it's like to work for a company in the US, what it's like to work in a nearly non-hierarchical environment, how GitHub has changed since I've joined in December 2012 and why I didn't start an Octocat oil painting career.

If you prefer text, look no further! Christian has also transcribed our two hour long conversation in this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Schepp/9fb648c7ca4b5ce9e4a4).
