I am happy to announce that I've got invited by [Sipgate](http://www.sipgate.de/) to talk at [LeanDUS](https://www.leandus.de/) in Duesseldorf, Germany on March 25th!

The plan is to talk a little about what it's like to work at GitHub and to look back at 2 1/2 years of working on GitHub Enterprise, both from a development and support experience. The talk will be held in German and you'll also need to grab a ticket on the [LeanDus website](https://www.leandus.de/) in advance.
