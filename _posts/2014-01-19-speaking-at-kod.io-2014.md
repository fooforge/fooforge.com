I'll be speaking at this year's [kod.io](http://linz.kod.io) in Linz on March 1st, together with lots of other [interesting speakers](http://linz.kod.io/#speakers). I haven't done much public speaking in 2013 and rather concentrated on getting up to speed at GitHub, so I'm thrilled to be able to speak again this year!

> In order to become a better developer you’ll have to spend some time doing support. Here at GitHub developers help out with support on a regular basis, leading to a better experience for our customers. Some even work on both: half development, half support. I’m going to show you why I think support is awesome and how it makes you better at writing code!
