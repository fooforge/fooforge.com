On May 19th I'm going to give a 20 minute *developer keynote* at the [ESRI UK conference](http://www.esriuk.com/events/annual-conference-2015) in London.

> GitHub is a web-based repository hosting service and with close to 9 million users and over 20 million software projects hosted on GitHub.com alone, we have a real impact on how the world builds software! In 2014, Microsoft open sourceâ€™d .NET on GitHub and saw a spike in contributions shortly thereafter. ESRI is a long-time and avid GitHub user and uses it for both in-house and Open Source development. All around the world, companies rely on our products for moving software projects forward.
>
> This talk will introduce you to GitHub, explain what makes it so special and show you how easy it is to join the community to start working on software projects.
