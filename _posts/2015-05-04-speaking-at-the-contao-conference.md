Earlier this year, I've got invited to speak at this year's [Contao Conference](http://contao-konferenz.de/). It'll take place in Lueneburg, Germany from May 28th to 29th. Once more, I'm going to talk about how to provide stellar customer support. The talk will be held in German and I'll be around on both days. I've got next to none experience with Contao and it's been a while since I've had my hands on a PHP project, so this is going to be fun!
