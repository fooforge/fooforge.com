This is a bit of a short notice, but tomorrow I'm going to speak about GitHub and our take on support at [Tech Talent Nights](https://www.facebook.com/events/607593989325248/) in Aarhus, Denmark. We're going to start at around 4:30 PM with an introduction to Revision control systems, Git and GitHub and make our way eventually to how we run support at GitHub. The event ends at around 6:15 PM after a Q&A session.

The exact address is:

> Lille Auditorium, Bygning 5510  
> Åbogade 34  
> 8200 Aarhus N., Denmark

You can register for the event [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/607593989325248/), but simply showing up will probably also work. Looking forward to meet you in Aarhus tomorrow!
