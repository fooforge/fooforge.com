I'll be attending OpenTechSchool Hamburg's [*GitHub from Scratch* workshop](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-hamburg/events/146838202/) tomorrow, Saturday Nov 30th. Looks like there will be plenty of people eager to learn how to start using GitHub to build and collaborate on software. At the time of this writing there're still 5 free spots available, so if you want to learn more about GitHub or want to shake hands in meatspace [sign up](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-hamburg/events/146838202/)!

The workshop is going to start at 10 am and takes place here ([maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Sch%C3%A4ferkampsallee+16%2C+Hamburg)):
