On May 23rd, 24th I'll be in Hamburg, Germany attending the [Hamburg Hackathon](http://hamburg-hackathon.de/hackathon/) organized by the [Hamburg Geekettes](http://www.geekettes.io/cities/hamburg/) & [App Camps](http://www.appcamps.de/) as a member of their jury. I've been there last year already and had a great time. The atmosphere and venue was great, and so were the people. They have great prizes too, and I must admit I'm a little jealous given the fact that as a member of the jury I'm not allowed to participate... ;)

Sadly, due to popular demand the registration is already closed. That being said, you can [still apply](https://docs.google.com/a/github.com/forms/d/1uRVIkocxTh0UZCkeXYRsGXjP9CI51l5iRbkp_f6psSk/viewform?c=0&w=1) to get added to the wait list or to be informed when their next hackathon is taking place.

See you in Hamburg! \o/
