To my excitement, I've got invited to become a mentor and member of the jury at [Hack-ing.io](http://hack-ing.io), a hackathon that takes place in Istanbul, Turkey at Ko√ß University from October 31st to November 2nd. The mission is to improve the world of mobile payment, e.g. by building systems that would simplify money transfers or that would allow alternative ways to pay.
