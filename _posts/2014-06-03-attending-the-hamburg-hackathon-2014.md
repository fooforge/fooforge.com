Organized by the [Hamburg Geekettes](http://www.geekettes.io/) and [Open Tech School Hamburg](http://www.opentechschool.org/hamburg/) as well as [sponsored by](http://hamburg-hackathon.de/hackathon/#sponsors) a Gazillion™ companies like XING, OTTO, ThoughtWorks, Wooga or GitHub we're going to hack on anything that goes under the *"For a better working life!"* motto.
