Later this month I'm going to speak about how we run Support here at GitHub at the ["Night of Support"](http://night-of-support.at/) in Vienna on the 15th of May. It's a panel discussion between Laura Gaetano (Customer Support at [NTRY Ticketing](https://ntry.at/)), Marko Locher (Support Engineer at [Codeship](https://codeship.com/)), me, and the crowd. The venue is [sektor5](http://www.sektor5.at/), we're going to start at 6 PM.
