On October 10th at 10 am I'll be kicking off the second day of [Code Talks 2014](http://www.codetalks.de/session_post/customer-support-bei-github-support-kann-auch-spass-machen/) in Hamburg, Germany. Of course, I'll be talking about my favorite topic: "How GitHub runs support, why support's awesome, and what can be done to make it more enjoyable". It'll be a revised version of what I've been talking about at various conferences this Spring and will be held in German for the very first time.

[The venue](http://www.codetalks.de/location/) looks pretty awesome, it's a multiplex cinema. I'll be talking in "Saal 1" which has roughly a thousand seats; needless to say that I'm quite excited!

As an aside, I have two free tickets to give away and five tickets offering a 50% discount each. Send me an email if you're in need of a ticket. First come, first serve and only as long as the conference's not sold out.
