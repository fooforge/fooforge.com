On October 10th at 10 am I'll be kicking off the second day of [Code Talks 2014](http://www.codetalks.de/) in Hamburg, Germany. Of course, I'll be talking about my [favorite topic](http://www.codetalks.de/session_post/customer-support-bei-github-support-kann-auch-spass-machen/):

> "How GitHub runs support, why support's awesome, and what can be done to make it more enjoyable".

It'll be a revised version of what I've been talking about at various conferences this Spring and will be held in German for the very first time. The venue looks pretty awesome, it's a [multiplex cinema](http://www.codetalks.de/location/). I'll be talking in "Saal 1" which has roughly a thousand seats and a 11 meter high and 24 meter wide screen. Needless to say that I'm quite excited!

As an aside, I have **two** free tickets to give away and **five** tickets offering a 50% discount each. If you're in need of a ticket, send me [an email](mailto:mike@fooforge.com). One ticket per person, first come, first serve and only as long as the conference's not sold out!

**Update:**  
The two free tickets are gone. 5x 50% discount tickets are still available.
