### Mike Adolphs

Mike Adolphs is an Operations expert based in Luebeck, Germany. Previously building and automating server infrastructures for [nugg.ad](http://nugg.ad) in Berlin and [XING](https://www.xing.com/) in Hamburg, he's now making people's life a little easier at [GitHub](https://github.com/) in San Francisco. For the past one and a half years he's been working on technical support for the GitHub Enterprise product - his first support-orientied role ever since, allowing him to deep dive into other people's code on a daily basis.

He's also speaking in front of people every once in a while and interested in making this more of a regular thing. Let him know if you're looking for speakers!

Mike is currently not available for hire. That said, feel free to let him know about interesting remote jobs. Maybe you can pick up the conversation again once the situation has changed.
